    """
This application helps you **find the best dish** for your taste using _fuzzy logic_.
Instead of giving binary choices, it analyzes your **preferences gradually**, just like humans think.

---

### 💡 How It Works

1. You tell us what you like: sweet, spicy, cheap, hot, filling...
2. You rate how important each feature is.
3. The app finds the best-matching dishes based on fuzzy logic.
